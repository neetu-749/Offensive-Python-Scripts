# ðŸ“Œ Purpose of This Script:
This script is a basic packet sniffer that captures raw network packets using raw sockets.

# ðŸ”¹ Use Cases:
- Capturing network traffic for analysis.
- Understanding how raw sockets work.
- Learning network security and penetration testing.
- Debugging incoming network packets.

# ðŸ“Œ How to Run This Script:

# ðŸ”¹ On Windows (Run as Administrator):
python sniffer.py

# ðŸ”¹ On Linux (Run as Root):
sudo python sniffer.py

# ðŸ’¡ Notes:
- On **Windows**, the script captures **all packets** by enabling promiscuous mode.
- On **Linux**, it captures **only ICMP packets** unless modified.
- You **must run this script with admin/root privileges** to access raw sockets.
